# Solar-Tracking system #

### Ultimate Goal ###
Finding the most efficient positioning and/or form of a solar array based on common circumstances 

### Summary ###
A solar array with improved efficiency by tracking the sun. The solar array will be mounted on a stand with 2 degres of freedom. Different forms and arrangements will be tested in the process.

### Tracking ###
The sun will be tracked by an infrared camera mounted on a seperate mounting, which is adjusted to track to the sun.

### Adjustment of the array ###
The mounting of the array will be equipped with motors which adjust the angle and rotation of the panels based on the values from the camera mount.
